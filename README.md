# Linux Sys Admin

This repository contains material
for a course on Linux systems administration.
The content is written in markdown (see **src/** directory),
and is built using [mdBook][mdbook].

The book is complete (as of August 13, 2022)
and is hosted using GitHub Pages:
[https://cseanburns.github.io/linux_sysadmin/](https://cseanburns.github.io/linux_sysadmin/)

I consider this book a live document that will
be updated throughout the year
(probably more frequently before and
during the fall semesters when I teach this course).
There's still more I can cover, and
I will work to make the content clearer or less confusing
as I learn from my students what needs to be addressed.

The **archive/** directory contains
prior content that I want to save separately.

## To Do

- add readings from [Computer System Engineering][cse50005]
- add reading on Linux Filesystems [Understanding Linux Filesystems][linus_fs]
