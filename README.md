# Linux Sys Admin

This repository contains material for a course on Linux systems administration.
The content is written in markdown (see **src/** directory), and is built using [mdBook][mdbook].

The book is complete (as of August 26, 2024) and is hosted using GitHub Pages:
[https://cseanburns.github.io/linux_sysadmin/](https://cseanburns.github.io/linux_sysadmin/)

I consider this book a live document that will be updated throughout the year.

The **archive/** directory contains prior content that I want to save separately.
